Prettypre
=========
The <pre> </pre> tags are used in WordPress websites to designate when code samples are being typed.  This field is formatted in a standard way for many templates.

This project aims to add some flavor to the <pre> tag by pretty-ing it up a bit.  I'll add to the CSS over time, but I'd love for some help re-creating the terminals of previously popular operating and hardware systems.  Remember what the terminal of a Tandy looked like?  Make it happen in CSS and I'll gladly add to the master.

There are a few rules:

1) Class name should be descriptive but less than 10 characters.
2) When you create a new class, please create a corresponding demo in the demo.html file.
3) Please only use web-safe, Google or similarly reliable fonts.
4) SUGGESTIONS WELCOME!
