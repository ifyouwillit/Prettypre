Prettypre
=========
Update: This project has been turned into a WordPress plugin.

The &lt;pre&gt; tag is used in websites to designate when code samples are being typed.  This field is formatted in a standard way which helps user delineate example code that is written by the author.

The Prettypre project exists to add some flavor to the &lt;pre&gt; tag by pretty-ing it up a bit.  I'll add to the CSS and plugin features over time, but I'd love for some help re-creating the terminals of previously popular operating and hardware systems.  Remember what the terminal of a Tandy looked like?  Make it happen in CSS and I'll gladly add to the master.

There are a few rules:

<ul>
  <li>Class name should be descriptive but less than 10 characters.</li>
  <li>Please only use web-safe, Google or similarly reliable fonts.</li>
  <li>SUGGESTIONS WELCOME!</li>
</ul>
